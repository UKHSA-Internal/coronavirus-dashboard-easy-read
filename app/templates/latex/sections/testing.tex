Testing is where we do a test to see who has coronavirus.
Some people are tested more than once.

There {{ latest.value | pluralise("was", "were", "were") }} {\bf{{ latest.value | format_number }}}
test{{ latest.value | pluralise("", "s", "s") }} reported on {{ latest.formatted }}.
This shows {{ latest.change | comparison_verb("an increase", "a decrease", "no change" ) }}
{% if latest.change != 0 -%}
of {\bf{{ latest.percentage | format_number }}\%}
{%- endif %}
compared to the previous 7 days.


Between {{ lastWeek.formatted }} and {{ latest.formatted }}, there have
been {\bf{{ latest.rollingSum | format_number }}} tests.
